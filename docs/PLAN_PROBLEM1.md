# PLAN — Problem 1: High-Fidelity Physics + SITL UAVs (CoopFC)

*Living checklist. Approved 2026-06-11. Source plan: Claude Code session
`based-on-last-pr-inherited-blossom`. Checkboxes updated every task; each task =
TDD unit (tests first, implement, suite green, tick). Stop-and-replan rule applies
per task — gates are never loosened silently.*

## Status log

- 2026-06-11 — Plan approved. Tier-F fixed-wing interceptor **confirmed out of
  Problem-1 scope** (user decision; ROADMAP Phase-1 item). Cadence: phase-by-phase,
  stop at each phase GATE for user review.
- 2026-06-11 — Pre-change baseline on `feature/urban-environment` (clean tree):
  **160 passed in 51.69s** (31 test files). P0 started.

## Context

Based on PR #6 (`feature/urban-environment`, SRS v0.3). Simulator today: 20 Hz fixed-step,
synchronous bus, point-mass kinematics (`sim/physics.py` self-declared "physics-lite"); UAVs are
high-level mode-FSM Python nodes with perfect nav, no autopilot, no onboard sensors, no health
monitoring; engagement = single Pk roll (DESIGN_REVIEW 1.1: core thesis unfalsifiable).

**Objective (Problem 1):** (a) physics modeled 1:1 — 6DOF dynamics, motors/ESC/battery,
atmosphere/wind, sensor physics; (b) each fleet UAV = running software instance ("virtual
microprocessor") executing its own high- and low-level software — SITL: embedded flight software,
sensor drivers, low-level control, CBIT. Other problems deferred until done.

**User decisions (binding):** flight stack = **CoopFC, custom in-repo flight software we author**
(not ArduPilot/PX4/Renode — those rejected/deferred after research); SITL scope = **fleet only**
(threats = vectorized 6DOF + scripted autonomy, preserves 400-threat saturation); physics core =
**custom in-repo, vectorized, source-traceable per equation**; runtime = pure Windows Python
(numpy/scipy/pyyaml); RotorPy + ArduPilot SITL (WSL2) = offline validation oracles only.
Legacy point-mass mode stays behind a scenario flag; all 31 legacy test files keep passing.
**Round 2 decisions:** SITL telemetry = EKF estimate (nav error visible on ops channel; truth on
/eval); design envelope = **30+ SITL UAVs** (vectorization + perf budgets sized for 30 from day
one); numba/C extension only on perf-gate failure w/ profile evidence + user approval; FCU-side
hard fire interlock = follow-up task in P5 (P4 ships MC-side interlock byte-equivalent to today).
**Round 3 decisions (2026-06-11):** Tier-F fixed-wing interceptor OUT of Problem-1 scope.

## Architecture (synthesis of 3 design agents)

### Instance model — in-process `VirtualMCU` (subprocess rejected)
20 UAVs × 2 processors (FCU + MC) = ~9,000 SW ticks/sim-s. Subprocess lockstep IPC on Windows
≈ 2.4 s sync overhead/sim-s + 60 s spawn + 3 GB RSS → rejected. In-process `VirtualMCU` with
isolation made mechanical:
- ctor `(params, clock: VirtualClock, rng, ports)` — no World/bus/env can physically enter
- import-fence test: AST-walk `coopfc/`+`mc/`, assert no import of `sim/`/`threats/`/`sensors/`/`risk/`
- mailbox-only comms (`core/ports.py`); bus callbacks only append to inbox, drained at own tick
- per-MCU exception fence = "processor crash" CBIT/world event (free SIM-SIL-003 fault mode)
- per-MCU VirtualClock + named RNG streams
Port/mailbox seam = future subprocess transport attach point (hybrid deferred, not designed away).

### Time — two-level clock
World macro-step `dt=0.05` stays the bus epoch (C2 1 Hz, fusion 5 Hz, recorder 5 Hz, RunController
untouched). Inside it, SITL micro-loop at `BASE_HZ=800` (scenario data, min 400; CI profile lower):
plant RK4 800 Hz; IMU+rate loop 400 Hz; attitude 100 Hz; EKF/velocity/position/baro/mag/link/CBIT-fast
50 Hz; GPS 10 Hz; CBIT-slow/health 1 Hz. Frozen micro-tick order (determinism contract):
devices sample truth → per-vehicle scheduler runs due tasks (drivers→estimator→controllers→mixer→
PWM→CBIT→link) → MC tick if due → latch actuators → ONE batched fleet RK4 → threat batch.
Rate ratios validated at scenario build (no silent rounding).

### Boundary refactor (strangler, legacy untouched)
`InterceptorUav` → 4 artifacts: `physics/multirotor.py` plant (world-owned, fleet-vectorized) +
`hw/` device models + CoopFC FCU instance + `mc/interceptor_app.py` (FSM/guidance/fire-control
ported near line-for-line, flying on EKF estimates, commanding velocity setpoints over modeled
FCU↔MC link instead of `body.command_velocity`). `sim/vehicle.py FriendlyVehicle` adapter keeps the
`world.friendlies` duck-type (`.position .velocity .mode .body.position .effector .link_quality`) —
comms registration, mounted sensors, enemy evasion, adjudicator, recorder, eval ALL unchanged.
Clearance interlock moves verbatim into `mc/fire_control.py` (same topics, constants MIN_PK=0.30,
CLEARANCE_TIMEOUT_S=3.0 — PHY-UAV-021 preserved). MC↔C2 rides existing `CommsModel` unchanged.

Scenario YAML: `fidelity: {fleet: pointmass|sitl, threats: pointmass|sixdof}` (defaults pointmass)
+ `sitl: {base_hz, fcu rates, mc tick, link {latency_s, bandwidth_bps}}`. Airframe params:
interceptor = 12 kg quad-X racer-class, 12S, ~320 KV, T/W≈3.6, drag tuned to 80 m/s at 65° tilt —
flagged invented-but-self-consistent, pinned by trim tests.

### CBIT (first-class deliverable)
Fault dictionary ~22 codes (IMU_STALE/RANGE/NOISE, GYRO_STUCK, GPS_LOSS/DEGRADED, BARO/MAG faults,
EKF_INNOV/DIVERGED, DR_BUDGET_LOW, MOTOR_RESPONSE(i)/SAT_PERSIST, BATT_LOW/CRITICAL/SAG_ANOM/
CELL_IMBALANCE, LINK_C2_LOSS/LINK_MC_LOSS, SCHED_OVERRUN, PARAM_CRC, ALIGN_FAIL, WDOG_MISS) with
severity/latching/inhibit_arming/inhibit_fire/degraded_mode. Monitors at 50 Hz + 1 Hz. Degraded
modes: GPS loss → dead-reckon + inhibit_fire + RTL on DR budget; mag fault → yaw-from-GPS-course;
batt critical → LAND; EKF diverged → FAILSAFE_ATT + inhibit_fire; C2 loss → never self-authorize.
Northbound `UavHealth` msg 1 Hz on routed topic; ICD frame `uavs[].health` additive only.

### ICD/recorder — additive only
`UavState` gains optional `attitude_q`/`health`/`nav_quality` (None in pointmass mode). Recorder
adds per-UAV `att`/`health` keys only when present; ICD_RUNTIME.md bumped additively same commit.
Frontend untouched. SITL telemetry reports EKF **estimates** (nav error operationally visible);
truth stays on /eval.

## Phases & tasks

Critical path P0→P1→P2→P3→P4 (~70% of effort). Lane B (P6) parallel after P1; Lane C (P7 comms/
debris) anytime after P0; P7 flyout last. Cadence: stop at each phase GATE for user review.

### P0 — Foundations (M) — only phase touching legacy behavior
- [x] P0-1 `docs/PLAN_PROBLEM1.md` living checklist (2026-06-11)
- [x] P0-2 pytest markers `slow`/`perf`/`oracle` in pyproject; default run excludes
      slow/perf/oracle per Stated Assumptions ("default pytest run stays fast") —
      note: task line originally said perf/oracle only; assumptions section governs.
      `--strict-markers` added. Tests: `tests/test_markers.py` (2026-06-11)
- [x] P0-3 characterization pins: SMALL_SCENARIO + urban_raid(60s, seed 7) event+summary
      golden files in `tests/fixtures/golden/`; test `tests/test_characterization.py`;
      re-record only via `scripts/record_golden.py` at P0-7 (2026-06-11)
- [x] P0-4 `sil/clock.py` VirtualClock + RateGroupScheduler + MicroScheduler; `World.micro`
      seam (None = legacy). Pins reproduce bit-for-bit with seam attached at K=1 AND K=4;
      integer-tick clock exact at 1e6 ticks; non-divisor rates rejected.
      Tests: `tests/test_sil_clock.py` (20) (2026-06-11)
- [x] P0-5 scenario `fidelity` flags parsed+validated; defaults pointmass/pointmass; sitl→
      NotImplementedError (P4), sixdof→NotImplementedError (P6); unknown keys/values rejected;
      stored in `Scenario.meta["fidelity"]` (recordings untouched until P4-7).
      Tests: `tests/test_fidelity_flags.py` (9) (2026-06-11)
- [ ] P0-6 `core/rng.py` RngRegistry; migrate weather→comms→sensors→adjudicator/debris→threats
      off `world.rng` one consumer per task; order-independence test (extra no-op consumer leaves
      other draws identical)
- [ ] P0-7 stochastic re-baseline: 10-seed MC before/after report committed; re-record pins ONCE;
      hit-rate floors re-affirmed or user sign-off

- [ ] P0-9 `docs/ORDERING.md` bus/step ordering contract + `tests/test_ordering.py` (fixes 5.2 doc-side)
- GATE: 31 legacy files green; order-independence proves 5.1 fixed

### P1 — Physics core, standalone (L) — vectorized `(N,·)` from day one
- [ ] P1-1 `physics/rigid_body.py` batched quat RK4: free-fall/quat-rotation analytic, energy drift
      <1e-9/60 s vacuum, RK4 order slope test
- [ ] P1-2 `atmosphere.py` ISA + `dryden.py` MIL-F-8785C (PSD matches analytic spectrum via Welch)
- [ ] P1-3 `motor.py` (step τ in 15-50 ms band, ω ceiling tracks sagging V) + `battery.py` ECM
      (instant sag = I·R0, recovery τ1, coulomb integral exact)
- [ ] P1-4 `multirotor.py`: hover trim Σkfω²=mg ±0.1%, ground-effect curve at z/R∈{0.6,1,2},
      terminal speed 80±5 m/s at 65° tilt (pins airframe params), Faessler drag signs
- [ ] P1-5 `fixedwing.py` Beard-McLain: trim at cruise (residual <1e-3·mg), C_mα<0, stall bounded;
      shahed_fw/jet_owa_fw/fpv_quad param files
- [ ] P1-6 `collision.py` prism/terrain + batch==scalar equivalence (1e-12) + perf microbench
      (`@perf`: 20-vehicle RK4 @800 Hz ≤0.25 s CPU/sim-s)
- [ ] P1-7 oracle traces: `scripts/oracle/export_rotorpy.py` → committed CSVs; `@oracle` tests
      pos RMSE <0.5 m / att <3° over 10 s matched-param flights
- [ ] P1-8 TRACEABILITY + RESEARCH.md citations per equation (TRC-001 same commit)

### P2 — Hardware device models (M)
- [ ] P2-1 `hw/imu.py`: Allan-variance slope test recovers configured N/B/K ±10% (`@slow`);
      FIFO/quantization/turn-on-bias-per-seed tests
- [ ] P2-2 `hw/gps.py` (noise+random walk, 10 Hz, 120 ms latency exact) + fix-type field
- [ ] P2-3 `hw/baro.py` (ISA round-trip + drift) + `hw/mag.py` (theater field vector + GM bias)
- [ ] P2-4 `hw/seeker_gimbal.py` FOV/slew/servo (PHY-UAV-012) + adapter into `sensors/seeker.py`
- [ ] P2-5 `hw/esc_telem.py` + determinism/stream-uniqueness suite
- GATE: Allan suite green; 20-vehicle sensor stack ≤0.1 s CPU/sim-s

### P3 — CoopFC flight stack in isolation (XL — largest phase)
`sil/bench.py` harness: physics + hw + one FCU, no tactical stack. Import fence enforced.
- [ ] P3-1 `core/vec.py` (vs scipy Rotation) + `core/topics.py` + `params.py` CRC overlay
- [ ] P3-2 `sched.py` rate groups: exact fire counts over 10 s, overrun→fault, deterministic order
- [ ] P3-3 `hal/` + `drivers/`: staleness flags, unit round-trips
- [ ] P3-4 `estimation/alignment.py` (leveling accuracy, variance gate) + `ekf.py`: Sola F/Q
      predict, covariance symmetry/PD guard; GPS/baro/mag sequential fusion + chi-square gating +
      0.5 s ring-buffer OOSM; NEES/NIS 25-seed MC consistency (`@slow`); GPS-denied drift <envelope
      5 min (PHY-UAV-011); 50 m spoof step rejected
- [ ] P3-5 `control/` cascade + `mixer.py`: rate rise <60 ms overshoot <20%; 30° attitude step
      settle <0.5 s; velocity zero steady-state error; anti-windup ramp recovery; desat priority
- [ ] P3-6 `fcu.py` boot/PBIT/arming/modes + `battery_monitor`/failsafes: PBIT-blocks-arming,
      setpoint-timeout→POS_HOLD, link-loss→RTL timeline, RTL home from 2 km under wind
- [ ] P3-7 `link/coop_link.py`: framing/heartbeat/latency/bandwidth-queue determinism
- [ ] P3-8 bench acceptance flights: hover RMS <0.15 m calm / <1.0 m in 8 m/s+Dryden; 200 m
      waypoint square cross-track <2 m; run-twice pins
- [ ] P3-9 `@oracle` ArduPilot SITL (WSL2) waypoint-square envelope comparison, procedure doc'd
- [ ] P3-10 tuning-stop rule: tolerances unmet after budgeted tuning → STOP and replan (never
      loosen gates silently)
- GATE: bench + NEES + oracle + determinism; 1-vehicle RTF ≥20×, 20-instance projection ≥1×

### P4 — Fleet integration (XL — riskiest; staged strangler)
- [ ] P4-1 `sil/vehicle.py` FriendlyVehicle protocol-conformance test (pins full duck-type contract)
      + `sil/fleet.py` SitlEngine into `world.step` (wind becomes force, not displacement)
- [ ] P4-2 Stage 1 velocity passthrough: InterceptorUav keeps FSM, `command_velocity` routes over
      link to FCU OFFBOARD; sitl twin of guidance intercept test; 1-interceptor kill in
      SITL_SMALL_SCENARIO
- [ ] P4-3 Stage 2 MC split: tactical logic → `mc/` apps on own VirtualMCU (PHY-UAV-010/011);
      `interceptors/uav.py` thin shell in sitl mode; clearance-interlock sitl twins byte-equivalent
- [ ] P4-4 energy/telemetry rewire: ECM battery via FCU telemetry; UavState from MC estimates only
      (truth quarantine holds); import-boundary test
- [ ] P4-5 sentinels as MC app + sitl twin of test_sentinel
- [ ] P4-6 `tests/test_sitl_end_to_end.py`: ≥1 kill, 0 CRITICAL wrecks, determinism pin; sitl gets
      OWN re-baselined floors (3-seed CI + 10-seed `@slow`), never reuses pointmass pins
- [ ] P4-7 recorder/ICD additive fields + ICD_RUNTIME v0.4 same commit + legacy-recording parse test
- [ ] P4-8 perf gate `@perf`: residential_raid sitl RTF ≥0.5× headless + committed profile; miss →
      pull fallback levers before proceeding
- GATE: all sitl twins + e2e + determinism + perf; legacy suite untouched and green

### P5 — CBIT + fault injection (M)
- [ ] P5-1 `cbit/` dictionary+engine+monitors: table-driven test per fault (detection latency,
      latch, degraded mode); `inhibit_fire` end-to-end suppression of staged fire request
- [ ] P5-2 scenario `faults:` block (sensor dropout, GPS denial, motor-out, link jam) injected at
      hw/link level on dedicated streams (SIM-SIL-003); no-fault scenarios bit-identical
- [ ] P5-3 degraded-mode scenarios: motor-out→controlled descent no-CRITICAL-wreck; GPS-denied
      5 min→DR bound+RTB; interlock holds under every injected fault
- [ ] P5-4 `UavHealth` ≥1 Hz to C2 + recorder + TRACEABILITY rows (PHY-UAV-013/033 → high)
- [ ] P5-5 FCU-side hard fire interlock: clearance token mirrored over coop_link; FCU refuses
      WEAPON_RELEASE without valid token (additive; MC-side interlock already live since P4)
- GATE: fault matrix 100% test-covered

### P6 — 6DOF threats + saturation (L; parallel after P1)
- [ ] P6-1 vectorized threat batch `(N,13)` fixed-wing + FPV multirotor; scripted autonomy as
      vectorized autopilot-lite (course/alt hold PD per Beard-McLain ch.6); per-class envelope pins
- [ ] P6-2 `EnemyDrone` adapter over batch rows; legacy threat mode behind flag; 6DOF twins of
      test_threats/test_threat_evasion
- [ ] P6-3 `benchmarks/saturation_400.yaml`: 400 threats + 20 sitl UAVs, RTF ≥0.2×, TEWA latency
      profiled (starts DESIGN_REVIEW 4.x evidence)
- [ ] P6-4 10-seed MC pointmass-vs-6DOF threat comparison report
- GATE: envelope pins + vector==scalar + full-scale run-twice determinism (`@slow`)

### P7 — Fidelity extras (L)
- [ ] P7-1 comms link budget: log-distance + shadowing + altitude-Rician → per-link SNR→loss
      replacing scalar (legacy mode kept); test_comms twins
- [ ] P7-2 debris drag-coefficient ballistics replacing retention scalar; predict==realize shared
      kernel consistency
- [ ] P7-3 munition flyout: projectile/net flyout + dispersion → miss distance → Pk(miss);
      adjudicator uses flyout in sitl mode, Pk-roll kept legacy; calibration vs envelope table
- [ ] P7-4 falsifiability closure (DESIGN_REVIEW 1.1): blocker-forced geometry measurably shifts
      miss-distance distribution vs tail chase over MC batch
- GATE: legacy adjudication untouched; cooperation measurable

## Performance budget & fallbacks
Design envelope: **30 SITL UAVs** (user decision). Estimate at 30 ≈1.0-1.3 s CPU/sim-s full
saturation (FCU plain-float hot path ~0.42, MC 0.08, batched plant 0.2, sensors 0.15, threats 0.2)
→ RTF gates (headless, 30-UAV fleet): ≥0.5× reference raid, ≥0.2× 400-threat saturation.
All perf microbenches sized at N=30. Rules: physics/hw vectorized across vehicles; no
numpy/allocation in ≥100 Hz paths; profiling gate each phase. Fallback levers in order:
(1) scenario rate profiles (CI 200/100/25 Hz documented), (2) mixed-fidelity fleets,
(3) IMU rate = control rate, (4) numba/C extension — only on gate failure, with committed profile
evidence, and explicit user approval (user-confirmed policy).

## Docs & process (every phase, same commit — TRC-001)
SRS: extend existing SIM-SIL-001..003 numbering (no new prefix). TRACEABILITY rows per model.
ICD additive only. RESEARCH.md citation per equation (Sola, Brescianini, Faessler,
Cheeseman-Bennett, Beard-McLain, MIL-F-8785C, Kalibr/PX4, Chen-Rincon-Mora ECM).
DESIGN_REVIEW 1.1/1.6/5.1/5.2/5.3 marked resolved as they close.

## Verification (end-to-end)
1. Per-task unit tests (TDD) — analytic physics, Allan variance, NEES/NIS, step responses, fault matrix.
2. Determinism: run-twice pins everywhere; order-independence suite invariant; legacy golden files.
3. Oracles: RotorPy trajectory diffs (CI via committed CSVs); ArduPilot SITL behavioral envelope (offline).
4. e2e: legacy suite green every phase; sitl twins (end_to_end, clearance_binding, energy_rearm,
   sentinel, guidance, comms); 0-critical-wrecks invariant; perf gates with committed profiles.
5. `coopuavs run scenarios/... --headless` in both fidelity modes; dashboard replay unchanged.

## Critical existing files modified (seams only)
- `src/coopuavs/sim/world.py` — SitlEngine insertion, RngRegistry, skip wind-displacement for sitl
- `src/coopuavs/sim/scenario.py` — fidelity flags, sitl build path, rate validation
- `src/coopuavs/interceptors/uav.py` — strangler source → `mc/` apps (legacy path kept)
- `src/coopuavs/core/messages.py` — additive UavHealth + optional UavState fields
- `src/coopuavs/viz/recorder.py` + `docs/ICD_RUNTIME.md` — additive frame fields, same commit
- `docs/TRACEABILITY.md`, `docs/SRS.md`, `docs/RESEARCH.md`, `docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md` — per phase

## Top risks
1. Python perf at 9k ticks/sim-s → conservative gates + profiling each phase + approved fallback levers.
2. P0-6 RNG migration shifts MC baselines → one consumer per task, 10-seed before/after report,
   tripped floor = stop-and-replan, never tolerance bump.
3. SITL intercepts worse than perfect-nav point-mass → own floors, EKF/controller tuned in P3
   before any tactical assertion; staged strangler isolates cause.
4. EKF/controller tuning rabbit hole → tolerances are tests-first spec + explicit stop rule (P3-10).
5. Hidden truth coupling via `world.friendlies` duck-type → protocol-conformance test pins contract
   before sitl build path lands.
6. ICD drift → additive-only + legacy-recording parse test.

## Resolved questions
1. Tier-F fixed-wing interceptor out of Problem-1 scope — **CONFIRMED out** (user, 2026-06-11).
